	<p><strong>We know shorts.</strong> We love shorts. To us, pants are a necessary evil - built for the work week because your boss just doesn't get it. You see a Chubster in pants or cargo shorts and he looks like a fish out of water; a radical fish that's probably krumping on the beach, but nonetheless OUT OF WATER. But this exact passion for shorts is why Chubbies are so righteous. We don't do pants. We don't do cargos. We don't do capris. We do shorts and only shorts. We have put painstaking effort into these shorts. We have engineered them for the toughest shorts critics - ourselves. And after years of development and fine tuning, we have finally emerged with a product that meets - nay, exceeds - our highest standards for shorts excellence.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Simply put, Chubbies are the best shorts out there.</strong> Comfortable, flexible, aerodynamic and most of all utterly Radical, Chubbies are everything a short should be and more. They are weekend BBQs in the sun. They are that perfect day on the beach. They are trampoline dodgeball and IM sports. They are radical moustaches and longboarding in Costa Rica. They go where no cargo shorts can go, and they do it in style. Don't take our word for it, though, try them out yourself. If you're not satisfied with your shorts' performance, just send 'em back. Simple as that. That's why we have such a lenient return policy - because Chubbies speak for themselves. It's time to take the plunge and join the shorts revolution with Chubbies. <strong>Your thighs will thank you.</strong></p>
